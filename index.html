# Terminology


---
## XR

> Extended reality is a term referring to all real-and-virtual combined environments and human-machine interactions generated by computer technology and wearables, where the 'X' represents a variable for any current or future spatial computing technologies.


---
## XR

.big-list[
- **Virtual Reality (VR):** creates a digital environment that _replaces_ the real world.

- **Augmented Reality (AR):** _overlays_ digital content into the real world.

- **Mixed Reality (MR):** Umm, a seamless blend of the two?!

- **3D Sound**: Either recorded with multiple microphones or reproduced via a speaker array or headset.

- **3D Video**: Similarly, multiple cameras record different perspectives on the same shot.

]

.footnote[https://cenatus.org/blog/18-hello-immersive-world-]

???

XR stands for eXtended Reality and is an umbrella term for Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), Mixed Reality (MR) and concepts like 3D Sound and 3D Video.
The distinctions can be blurry, but here is a one liner on each:




---
## 3D Sound

Generic term that encompasses systems for production and playback of multi channel or multi speaker audio.

???

Natural sound!


---

background-image: url(images/3d-sound.jpeg)
background-size: cover

---
### 3D Sound Variants

.big-list[
- **Surround sound e.g. Dolby 5.1, 7.1**, the kind found in movie theaters and home cinema systems.

- **Ambisonic systems**, an abstraction of a speaker array.

- **Dynamic binaural audio** 2 microphones to capture a “dummy head recording” that sounds like being present at the source on playback.
]

???

- Binaural playback is used in VR headsets, along with head tracking


---
## Spatial Audio

.big-list[
- **Head tracked, not head locked**  - Sound emanating from a fixed point in space and doesn't reposition as you move.

- **Externalisation** - in relation to the listener, coming from elsewhere.

- **Presence** - gives the sense of _really_ being there.
]


---
## CIF2021 Project: 10013417

### Research and development of two prototype eXtended Reality (XR) experiences.

???

- Research lab environment. Playful and exploratory


---
### Business Opportunity

### Innovation

### Impact

### What next?

???

Slide 2: Area of focus, a short overview of the project.
It’s split into a quadrant asking you to answer 4 key questions using no more than 3 or 4 bullets per question (template attached).


---
## Business opportunity

.big-list[
- Extended Reality (XR) audio experiences sit within an emergent market bridging entertainment and culture, technology and the sciences. The production of XR experiences are under-resourced within the industry to meet the vast demand from the arts & culture sector.

- The total XR market is estimated to be worth ~30 Bn USD and predicted to grow to ~900 Bn during 2021-27 [[1]](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210322005549/en/Extended-Reality-XR-Market-Report-2020---Global-Forecast-to-2026---ResearchAndMarkets.com).
Our strategy helps us develop the skills and knowledge whilst suitably positioning us within the industry to capitalise on explosive growth.
]

???

# P1 - Proun/Rhizome

1. P1 - Goals
2. P1 - Creative vision
3. P1 - Strategy
4. P1 - Results


---
### _Proun/Rhizome_ explores the use of procedural audio to create an interactive, sonic artwork that can adapt and transform in real time within VR, based upon user position and interaction.

???

Procedural audio is non linear sound that is generated at runtime that typically utilizes synthesis driven by gameplay parameters


---

Full immersion via headset!



---
# P1 - Goals

.big-list[
- Prototype an immersive, interactive audiovisual artwork for a VR headset.

- Learn Unreal Engine and the new MetaSounds audio engine to evaluate viability.

- Implement procedural audio.

- Connect with the UE/MetaSounds community and become early adopters.

- Disseminate learning via [shared code](https://github.com/cenatus/unreal_playground) and [blog posts](https://cenatus.org/blog/27-building-an-fm-synth-with-metasounds).

---
# P1 - Creative vision


---
### **_Proun_** is a Virtual Reality “activated environment”. Guided by “the supremacy of pure artistic feeling rather than on visual depiction of objects” from the Suprematists’ doctrine, we explored an abstract audiovisual space where the participant is guided through darkness by sonic and visual cues.


---
### **_Rhizome_** makes visible and audible the hidden life of information networks and prompts reflection on the invisible care and maintenance that ensures the life of such networks and infrastructure in the real world. Inspired by the working of mycorrhizal networks in the natural world, it presents a forest of communicating nodes which use sound and light to guide the participant through the Virtual Reality space to care and sustain the ecosystem.


---
# P1 - Strategy

.big-list[
- Unreal Engine and MetaSounds tutorials.

- Built various playground projects.

- Built and documented a number of Frequency Modulation (FM) synth patches and [shared](https://cenatus.org/blog/27-building-an-fm-synth-with-metasounds) with the community.

- [Moodboard](http://www.gomoodboard.com/boards/FbxxpBnP) and concepts.

- Shared wih mentors for feedback.

- Developed Proun & Rhizome.

- Iterated on development and concepts.

# P2 - Goals

.big-list[
- Prototype an audio only, augmented reality experience.

- Create a head tracked experience.

- To be convincing, the experience must have a sense of externalisation (the sound in relation to you) and presence (_really_ being there).

- Explore and evaluate Apple's ARkit and RealityKit frameworks.

- Explore PHASE audio engine.

- Connect with the AR community.

- Disseminate learning via [shared code](https://github.com/cenatus/audio-ar-playground) and [blog posts](https://cenatus.org/blog/28-the-situationists-walkman---an-audio-augmented-reality-experience).

Concept, research and development of a headtracked, spatial Audio Augmented Reality experience delivered for iPhone and Airpods.

# P2 - Creative Vision


---
### Conceptually, we were interested in creating a playful, non-directed experience that offered surprising, uncanny sonic augmentation to the world around you. Using the city as a playground - a canvas upon which we could project directed audio stimulus that’s unconstrained by the physicality and hardware of a gallery setting, augmenting familiar surroundings with another layer of perceptual information. A 3D graphical score with a participant conductor.


---

### Inspired by the Situationist idea of the _dérive_ - "a mode of experimental behaviour linked to the conditions of urban society: a technique of rapid passage through varied ambiances."  - an undirected, spontaneous exploration of the urban environment.


---

### In contrast to the discourse around Facebook's metaverse strategy and the fear of _enclosure and commercialisation_ of public spaces, explore the playful, open-ended possibilities of augmentation technology for artistic expression, and a means of celebrating the importance of open, public spaces and expanding them into AR.


---
# P2 - Strategy

.big-list[

- Decide on a London location for the experience.

- Create a brief and commission sonic artists.

- Explore technical solutions for accurate listener location.

- Familiarisation with Apple's ARKit, RealityKit and Reality Composer.

- Prototype off site with local, object anchors.

- Trial various audio engines to control sound shape, direction and attenuation, settling on PHASE.
